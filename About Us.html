            <h1>LOGO DESCRIPTION</h1>The Lamborghini logo symbolizes the founder’s zodiac character – the Taurus or a bull.Ferruccio’s love of bullfights was depicted in the logo and Lamborghini cars get their styles from famous bulls.The golden bull ready for bullfights is depicted on the black shield with the golden title “Lamborghini” above.The bull represents Lamborghini sports cars’ power.The shape of the Lamborghini symbol depicts a shield and demonstrates golden snorting bull.The emblem was symbolical like any other car logos.This bull represents consistency, fortitude and power.Being a manufacturer of high-quality sporting cars,the logo has immense recognition deeply along with other brand logos. The bull symbol actually signs founder’s,Ferruccio, zodiacal sign (Taurus), besides; it is obviously attended by the manufacturer’s title, Lamborghini.Contrary to some other “patriot” Italian manufacturers, Lamborghini does not apply the Italian colors on its symbol.The famous golden Taurus with a black field of the Lamborgini symbol holds great similarity to the horse and yellow field of the Ferrari symbol.The similarity was not just a coincidence, since Ferruccio has a longstanding rivalry with Ferrari.Since the golden bull in the Lamborghini symbol depicts excellence and wealthy tradition of the manufacturer, the black color reflects its power, prestige, elegance and integrity.
